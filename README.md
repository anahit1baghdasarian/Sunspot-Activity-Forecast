# Sunspot-Activity-Forecast

## Abstract:

This research project focuses on the analysis and forecasting of monthly sunspot data spanning from 1818 to 2019. The study aims to understand the sun's magnetic activity and its implications for Earth's climate and space weather. Time series forecasting techniques, specifically SARIMA and exponential smoothing models, are employed to predict monthly aggregated sunspot numbers based on historical observations. Additionally, a GARCH model is applied to analyze the forecasts of the SARIMA model. The research question addressed is the accuracy of forecasting monthly sunspot numbers using available dataset attributes and how the variability of sunspot numbers evolves over time. The findings of this study have implications for various stakeholders, including solar energy companies, climate scientists, space weather forecasters, and amateur astronomers, providing valuable insights into the behavior of the sun and its impacts on Earth and the space environment.
